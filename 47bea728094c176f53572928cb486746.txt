BACKGROUND  6 On 24 June 1994, following an audit, the Commissioner issued the respondent taxpayer with an amended assessment of income tax for the year ended 30 June 1988 including in his assessable income for that year an amount of $1,228,500 received by him in respect of a certain large infrastructure project..So much is exemplified in the following extract from p-95 of the transcript of the hearing on the second day 19 November 2004: MR QUINN Counsel for the Commissioner : Just briefly on penalty, we say it is a matter --- the Tribunal stands in the shoes of the Commissioner..If an objection had been made to the assessment of penalty and an objection decision had been made in relation to that matter, there may have been subject to the operation of s 14ZS of the Administration Act some basis for saying that the exercise of a power to remit by the Tribunal was in the words of Hill J in Secretary, Department of Social Security v Hodgson 1992 37 FCR 32 relevant to the making of the decision under review..20 While the taxpayer did not include in his objection a ground putting in issue the imposition of additional tax; and while the Commissioners objection decision disallowing the taxpayers objection did not, in consequence, deal with that issue; and while the taxpayer had no right to agitate the issue before the Tribunal unless the Tribunal otherwise ordered s 14ZZKa of the Administration Act, which the Tribunal did not, nevertheless, in deciding the taxpayers objection, the Commissioner could have further remitted the additional tax imposed at label D of the notice of amended assessment, pursuant to the discretion vested in him by subs 2273 of the ITAA 36..21 If this be right, then it is difficult to see why subs 431 of the AAT Act did not give the Tribunal jurisdiction to make that part of the decision against which this appeal is brought, namely, remission of the penalty matter to the Commissioner with the direction that the assessment for the year ended 30 June 1988 be amended by remitting additional tax in full..
